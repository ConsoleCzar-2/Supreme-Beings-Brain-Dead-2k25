positive cocci ) and gram negative organisms ( especially multi - drug resistance ( mdr ) negative bacilli ) are the most common causes of infections , but ifis remain the main cause of death and increase the mortality among respective patients , . \\n aspergillosis and mucormycosis are the most common mold infections in patients with aplastic anemia \\n . in reported case series by valera ( 2011 ) , in 32 patients with acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis , \\n all deaths were reported among patients with aplastic anemia despite surgical debridement and systemic antifungal therapy . \\n severe neutropenia predisposes these patients to more severe forms of ifis with a wide range of clinical manifestations . \\n gastrointestinal , upper air way , musculoskeletal   cardiac , renal , disseminated infection   and rhinocerebral / sino - orbital / rhinosinusitis   among the most common reported manifestations of ifis in patients with aplastic anemia . of these conditions \\n we report on a serious fungal infection in a case of aplastic anemia and offer an appropriate strategy for the treatment and prevention in such patients . \\n an 18 year old boy , known case of aplastic anemia since 7 years ago , admitted with severe headache and fever in emergency ward . \\n he was a candidate for bone marrow transplantation because of standard treatment failure that included corticosteroid , anti - thymocyte globulin ( atg ) and cyclosporine , and put on in transplant waiting list . \\n he had frequently received blood and platelet transfusion due to low hemoglobin ( hb ) level and often nose bleeding . on admission , he had severe leukopenia [ white blood cell count ( wbc ) : 100 ( without cell differentiation ) ] , anemia ( hb : 6.5 ) and severe thrombocytopenia ( platelet count : 6000 ) . \\n erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) and c - reactive protein ( crp ) were 130 and 48 , respectively . \\n after initial assessment , broad spectrum antibiotics ( piperacillin - tazobactam ) were started for him . \\n two days later , he developed pain , swelling and redness of the right side of face . \\n gradually , the patient exhibited high grade fever , chills , intolerable headache and periodic disorientation , so due to poor clinical response , an antifungal agent ( amphotericin - b deoxycholate ) was added to his antibiotic regimen on fifth day of admission . in serial physical examination ( after primary unilateral face swelling and cellulitis ) , he developed necrotic lesions in soft and hard palate followed by nasal septum , right alar groove and right nasolabial fold necrosis . \\n tomography scan ( ct scan ) was requested , which revealed right maxillary and ethmoidal sinus involvement ( fig . \\n surgical consult has been also requested for diagnostic aspiration and evaluation for surgical debridement . despite low platelet count , after receiving single donor platelet transfusion , \\n after primary aspiration , right maxillary sinus debridement was performed during single donor platelet transfusion and samples were sent for pathology . upon early surgical debridement and short time clinical improvement \\n caspofungin was added and second surgical debridement planned 10 days after the first one , and has been organized for short interval surgical sinus debridements during platelet transfusion , till it becomes completely clear . in the next surgical debridement tissue samples \\n were cultured on sabouraud dextrose agar ( merck , darmstadt , germany ) and also examined for aspergillus and candida dna by real time polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) and mucoral by nested pcr , . bacterial culture and specimen \\n finally , all involved sinuses , nasal cavity and overlying soft tissue were completely removed by anterior and posterior ethmoidectomy and sphenoidectomy . also , posterior part of septum was removed . \\n adjuvant therapy with gamma interferon 100 gr / day in combination with granulocyte - colony stimulating factor ( g - csf ) [ 300  gr / day primarily and then with full dose of 600  gr / day in two divided doses ] was added to the broad antibacterial and antifungal treatments . \\n other assessments including blood culture and urine culture were negative and chest x - ray , abdominal ultrasonography and echocardiography were normal in primary evaluations . however in serial chest x - rays , early possible signs of pulmonary involvement detected in about 3 weeks after his admission ( fig . \\n 2 ) . bilateral well - circumscribed ground - glass gray opacities were detected in these chest x - rays confirmed by spiral chest ct scan ( fig . \\n 3 ) . our further investigation into fungal infection revealed positive mucormycosis , aspergellosis and candidiasis by pcr and positive fungal culture for aspergillus flavus and candida albicans in repeated debridement ( fig . \\n sinus debridement during antifungal treatment was done in four times , but the patient 's condition gradually worse and eventually expired . \\n frequent episodes of profound and prolonged neutropenia , aggressive chemotherapy , exposure to fungal spores in non protected environment and consequently preadmission colonization with fungal agents and high risk condition such as aplastic anemia and acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) are some of typical examples that increase the risk of ifis . along with high clinical suspicions , early diagnosis and treatment ; multidisciplinary approach against ifis significantly reduced mortality . \\n constantly low absolute neutrophil count ( anc ) , lack of standard and secure control measures such as high - efficiency - particulate - air ( hepa ) in many centers and progressive nature of certain fungal infections such as mucormycosis ; all are important obstacles to our attempts toward controlling fungal infections in these patients . despite very low platelet count ( less than 610/microliter ) , \\n our patient underwent four times of successful surgical debridement , during continuous single donor platelet transfusions , without any hemostatic complications . in each times \\n he was referred to operation room after preparation of donor platelet for infusion during surgical debridement ( fig . \\n along with severe neutropenia , prolonged hospital stay and broad spectrum antibiotic therapy with damaged skin and mucosal barriers and presence of indwelling catheters predisposed our patient to colonization and infection with hospital acquired multidrug resistant organisms . \\n such patients are at greater risk for acquisition of mdr gram positive and gram negative organisms such as acinetobacters , methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsas ) and vancomycin - resistant enterococcus ( vres ) \\n . \\n this is an important point in management of these patients that should also take into consideration such as our patient which finally complicated by vre bacteremia . \\n diagnostic misconception based on primary clinical presentation is one of the other important challenges in the management of ifis in severe neutropenic patients . \\n although rhinocerebral / sino - orbital / rhinosinusitis ifis are frequently considered as clinical manifestation of mucormycosis , it is critical to obtain proper tissue specimens for culture and biopsy , whenever possible ; given the similar clinical presentations of aspergillosis . \\n mucoral family is difficult to cultivate and sensitivity of culture for this family was reported around 50%   and thus other diagnostic modalities ( histopathological carachtristics and molecular test ) should be considered , if needed . \\n co - detection of multiple fungi also is not an uncommon event in severe neutropenic patients and accurate diagnosis can help correct decision making in choosing proper antifungal regimen . although fever - driven approach for empirical antifungal therapy ; based on existing guidelines is currently applied in many hematology oncology centers worldwide , but this issue continues to be a challenge and ifis still is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in neutropenic patients with persistent fever . \\n other different treatment approaches either pre - emptive ( diagnostic - driven approach ) or targeted therapy also may be used , according to radiological findings , clinical symptoms and mycology test results . \\n these approaches have been tested by researchers in different populations and in various settings in neutropenic patients . despite the fact that implementation of these strategies substantially has reduced the burden of ifis in high risk patients , antifungal \\n currently , there is no recommendation about starting antifungal prophylaxis for patients with aplastic anemia ( as a one of the high risk groups ) in the latest guideline of infectious diseases society of america ( idsa , 2011 ) and 4th european conference on infections in leukemia ( ecil-4 , 2011 ) , . \\n although prompt diagnosis and early transplantation seem to be the only reliable modality in the protection of such patients against serious infectious complications ( mainly ifis ) , but based on our experience and also other similar reports we recommend that patients with aplastic anemia receive anti - mold prophylaxis during the period of profound and prolonged neutropenia ( anc less than 500/ microliter ) instead of other proposed strategies for the management of patients within pre - transplantation period . \\n it should be noted that in the case of aspergillosis indirect tests such as galactomannan and moleculer tests have been improved our diagnostic power for early detection of ifis due to aspergillosis . \\n yet , there is no standard diagnostic test for early detection of mucormycosis except histopathology and culture . \\n also , in centers with high incidence of mucormycosis , it seems better to better that use an agent which is active against both mucormycosis and aspegillosis for prophylaxsis . \\n the authors did not have any financial or other relationships , which could be regarded as a conflict of interest .\",\n          \"beyond its role of cellular energy currency and phosphate donor , atp plays a potent signaling role through its extracellular release and activation of cell surface purinergic receptors . \\n fast responses to atp are mediated through activation of p2x receptors , a family ( p2x1p2x7 ) of atp - activated ligand - gated ion channels and metabotropic effects through the activation of p2y receptors ( p2y12 , p2y4 , p2y6 , p2y1114 ) which couple to heterotrimeric g proteins . human leukocytes including monocytes , mast cells , neutrophils and central microglia express a diverse repertoire of p2y receptors though p2x1 , p2x4 and p2x7 are the dominant p2x subtypes present . \\n activation of purinergic receptors in leukocytes is coupled to the production and secretion of cytokines and other pro - inflammatory molecules including prostaglandin e2 . \\n purinergic receptors are associated with inflammation , with some receptors inhibited either directly ( p2y12 ) or indirectly through the activity of anti - thrombotic , in the case of platelet p2y12 , or anti - inflammatory agents , in the case of the action of statins on monocyte p2x4 . \\n atp can act as a non - peptide damage - associated molecular pattern ( damp ) release from injured cells and tissues . in this fashion \\n the release of cellular atp is unregulated and released due to cell lysis or puncture . \\n cell surface purinergic receptors are activated by this atp damp signal which serves to initiate an inflammatory response and promote wound healing . \\n however , atp can be released from cells physiologically and act as a critical signal for painful , inflammatory processes . \\n do release other nucleotides including utp and udp - sugars but our focus here is atp release . mechanisms of atp release during physiological processes remain diverse and controversial . \\n investigation into how cellular stress stimulates atp release in non - leukocytes suggests roles for connexin and pannexin hemichannels , maxi- and volume - regulated anion channels and efflux through the p2x7 receptor , though release routes and signal transduction mechanism underlying atp release in leukocytes remain poorly defined . \\n in neutrophils atp is released in response to activation of fmlp receptor by bacterially derived n - formylmethionine . \\n the precise release mechanism is unclear but occurs at the leading edge of migrating neutrophils . \\n released atp and its subsequent metabolism to adenosine at the cell surface activate p2y2 and a3 receptors serving to direct cell orientation and promote migration in response to chemotactic signals . \\n bacterially derived lipopolysaccharide can stimulate central microglia to secrete atp which in - turn activates neighboring astrocytes and modulates excitatory neurotransmission . \\n this raises the possibility that atp can act in a feed forward loop possibly amplifying responses to itself or other external cues which couple to atp secretion . \\n furthermore , such constitutive secretion leads to activation of cell surface gq - coupled p2y receptors which elevate intracellular calcium levels through release of calcium . \\n this mode of constitutive secretion generates a constant pericellular atp cloud or  halo  which appears to be important in regulating intracellular calcium homeostasis following p2y receptor activation . in cells of hematopoietic lineage such as monocyte / macrophage , nk killer and mast cells , secretory lysosomes have evolved as bifunctional organelles which combine classical degradative properties with secretion . \\n the mechanism of lysosomal atp transport remains undefined though a nucleotide transporter ( v - nut ) has been characterized for other atp containing vesicles . \\n the signal transduction coupling external cues such as cytokines , chemokines and bacterially derived molecules to atp release is poorly defined . \\n what are the release machines in leukocytes and do they differ from other cell types ? it is expected that therapeutic intervention in agonist stimulated atp release is a potentially novel route to pharmacological modulation of innate immune responses but also in chronic inflammatory disease where normal inflammatory responses are heighten and act deleteriously .\",\n          \"plexiform neurofibroma is the term applied to a diffuse neurofibromatosis of nerve trunks , which is often associated with an overgrowth of the skin and subcutaneous tissues . \\n it is a distinct type of neurofibroma that expands a nerve into a large tortuous mass of fibers that has a  bag of worms  appearance . \\n plexiform neurofibromas are the least common variant and usually are pathognomonic for nf i. the most commonly involved sites are the temple , upper lid , back of the neck , and the tongue . \\n oral manifestations of neurofibromatosis have been reported in only 4 - 7% affected persons , in which the tongue was the most commonly involved site . \\n this systemic process , originally described by von recklinghausen , is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a defect on chromosome 17 . \\n patients usually present in childhood with numerous cutaneous or subcutaneous neurofibromas , melanotic lesions in the iris called lisch nodules , caf au lait spots , and optic gliomas . \\n plexiform neurofibromas occur in only 17% of cases of nf i. when they occur in the setting of nf i , 91% are solitary lesions , and most of the lesions occur in the trunk , extremities , and head neck region . \\n histologically , neurofibroma consist of endoneural ground substance and schwann cells that extend outside the perineurium . \\n we present a case of an isolated plexiform neurofibroma of the tongue in a 11-year - old girl not associated with neurofibromatosis . \\n an 11-year - old girl was admitted to the department of e.n.t . of our institute , with the complaint of inability to close the mouth because of a large , asymmetrical , protruding tongue . \\n the girl had difficulty in swallowing , breathing , and clear speaking since early months of her life . \\n on palpation , the right side of the tongue was hypertrophied and the movements of the tongue were normal , but she was unable to hold the tongue completely in the mouth because of its enormous size . \\n there was also slight generalized swelling of the right side of the base of the tongue . \\n no neck glands were palpable and functions of v , vii , x , and xii cranial nerves were intact . \\n a magnetic resonance image was obtained to better assess the base of tongue , which revealed a 3  3  2.5 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass with infiltration in the tongue and tongue base , this lesion was hypervascular and well - circumscribed . under general anesthesia , \\n gross examination of the specimen revealed irregular surface which was soft in consistency [ figure 1 ] . \\n histopathological examination revealed well circumscribed multiple nodular lesions composed of elongated spindle wavy cells with muscle fibers in between , these wavy cells were arranged against a myxoid background . \\n an ophthalmologic examination was carried out which showed no eye lesions of neurofibromatosis ( such as lisch nodules in the iris , ephelides on eyelids , or ectopia lentis ) . \\n the skin of the whole body was examined and no caf au lait spots or frecklings of the axillary and inguinal region were observed . on plain radiograph , no bone pathology was found . \\n after the diagnostic work - up , surgical treatment was planned . under general anesthesia , \\n the tumor was approached intraorally , and the biopsy report was consistent with plexiform neurofibroma . \\n the movements of the tongue were preserved , and , in addition , a significant improvement in her speech was observed . \\n the patient has been on follow - up for 10 months and no additional treatment has been necessary . \\n gross picture of neurofibroma h and e - stained section showing spindle wavy - shaped cells seperated by fibromyxoid stroma , 400 h and e - stained section showing discrete well - circumscribed collection of spindle cells with muscle fibers in between , 100 \\n neurofibromas are benign tumors of neural origin , of which roughly 90% appear as solitary lesions . \\n solitary plexiform neurofibromas arising outside the context of nf i , as illustrated in the patient presented here , are quite rare , with only scattered cases reported in the literature till date . in the literature , there are only few reports of macroglossia caused by plexiform neurofibroma , and the cases are almost always associated with neurofibromatosis . \\n our patient had no eye lesion , no bone pathology , and no caf au lait spots or frecklings on the skin . \\n we could not find any other signs or symptoms other than isolated plexiform neurofibroma of the tongue to make a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis , and thus it was concluded to be a case of isolated plexiform neurofibroma of the tongue . when these ill - defined tumors grow in the head and neck , they are commonly symptomatic and disfiguring , causing upper airway obstruction , swallowing or mastication difficulties , or cosmetic distortion of the face . \\n diffuse plexiform neurofibroma , is also known as elephantiasis neurofibromatosa , which shows overgrowth of epidermal and subcutaneous tissue along with a wrinkled and pendulous appearance . \\n neurofibromas of the large nerves , which appear clinically as soft , drooping , and doughy masses , are benign neoplasms composed of neurites , schwann 's cells and fibroblasts within a collagenous or myxoid matrix . in contrast to schwannomas , they are nonencapsulated and engulf the nerve of origin . \\n plexiform neurofibromas , forming tortuous cords along the segments and branches of a nerve with a tendency to grow centripetally , are poorly circumscribed tumors . \\n it needs to be differentiated from schwannoma which is encapsulated , while plexiform neurofibroma is noncapsulated ; moreover , in schwannoma there are antony a and antony b along with prescence of verocay bodies on microscopic examination . since neurofibromas are usually multiple lesions , the whole body must be examined and investigated . in patient with oral neurofibroma , larynx and trachea must also be examined as in such a case lesions in the upper airway may cause respiratory obstruction . \\n plexiform neurofibromas should be monitored frequently because 5% may turn into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors . \\n differential diagnosis of such a tongue mass must include neurofibroma , schwannoma ( neurilemoma ) , lymphangioma , hemangioma , hamartoma , teratoma , pyogenic granuloma , nerve sheath myxoma , and cystic lesions such as mucoid cysts and dermoid cysts . \\n the standard treatment for neurofibromas has been surgical excision and the diagnosis can only be confirmed by histological examination . \\n early diagnosis in such a patient is very important and these patients need regular follow -

up to see the outcome of epm . \\n we reported a 38-year - old man complaining of nausea , malaise and transient loss of consciousness who was found to have severe hyponatremia . \\n neurologic deficits including altered mental status , behavioral disturbances , dysarthria and dysphagia developed despite slow correction of hyponatremia . \\n endocrine and imaging studies revealed hypopituitarism , nonfunctional pituitary macroadenoma and extrapontine myelinolysis . \\n transsphenoidal surgery was performed after three weeks of supportive therapy , when neurological symptoms improved significantly . \\n the patient recovered function completely 3 months after surgery . \\n our case indicates that outcome of epm can be good even with prolonged periods of severe neurologic impairment .\",\n          \"release and reception of extracellular atp by leukocytes plays a critical role in immune responses to infection , injury and cardiovascular disease . \\n leukocytes of both the innate , adaptive immune and central nervous system express a repertoire of cell surface receptors for atp ( p2x and p2y receptors ) and its metabolites . \\n atp acts as a damage - associated molecule pattern ( damp ) released by injured or dying cells . \\n detection of released atp by neighboring leukocytes initiates inflammation and wound healing . \\n however , recent evidence from our group and others suggests atp release by leukocytes themselves serves to regulate homeostatic mechanisms and coordinate responses to external pro - inflammatory cues . \\n examples include the homeostatic control of intracellular calcium and regulation of migratory guidance during chemotactic response to external cues . \\n though there has been some progress in elucidating atp release mechanisms of some mammalian cells types , release conduits and coupling signal transduction machinery remain larger elusive for leukocytes . \\n our recent studies suggest a role for secretory lysosomes in releasing atp in monocytes . though poorly defined , \\n targeting atp release mechanisms in leukocytes have great anti - inflammatory potential .\",\n          \"background . \\n psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by an accelerated turnover of epidermal cells and an incomplete differentiation in epidermis with lesion . \\n however , the exact etiology of psoriasis is unknown . \\n abnormalities in essential fatty acid metabolism , free radical generation , lipid peroxidation , and   release of lymphokines have been proposed . objective . \\n our purpose was to evaluate the plasma lipids and oxidized low - density lipoprotein accumulation in psoriatic skin lesion in order to ascertain the possible participation of oxidative stress and oxidative modification of lipids in pathogenesis of psoriasis . \\n methods . the study group included 84 patients with psoriasis , and 40 sex- and age - matched healthy volunteers . \\n blood lipid profile was determined . \\n psoriatic and nonlesional skin samples of psoriatic patients were evaluated for the presence of oxidized low - density lipoprotein by using an immune - fluorescent staining method . \\n results . \\n the mean levels of lipids ( total cholesterol , triglyceride , and ldl cholesterol ) in patients with psoriasis were found to be significantly higher than those of healthy subjects . \\n psoriatic skins were shown positive oxidized low - density lipoprotein staining . \\n there was no staining in nonlesional skin samples of the same individuals . \\n conclusion . \\n lipid peroxidation mediated by free radicals is believed to be one of the important causes of cell membrane destruction and cell damage . \\n this study shows for the first time the accumulation of oxidized low - density lipoprotein in psoriatic skin lesion . \\n we believe that accumulation of ox - ldl in psoriatic skin may have an important role in the immune - inflammatory events that result in progressive skin damage .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

positive cocci ) and gram negative organisms ( especially multi - drug resistance ( mdr ) negative bacilli ) are the most common causes of infections , but ifis remain the main cause of death and increase the mortality among respective patients , . \\n aspergillosis and mucormycosis are the most common mold infections in patients with aplastic anemia \\n . in reported case series by valera ( 2011 ) , in 32 patients with acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis , \\n all deaths were reported among patients with aplastic anemia despite surgical debridement and systemic antifungal therapy . \\n severe neutropenia predisposes these patients to more severe forms of ifis with a wide range of clinical manifestations . \\n gastrointestinal , upper air way , musculoskeletal   cardiac , renal , disseminated infection   and rhinocerebral / sino - orbital / rhinosinusitis   among the most common reported manifestations of ifis in patients with aplastic anemia . of these conditions \\n we report on a serious fungal infection in a case of aplastic anemia and offer an appropriate strategy for the treatment and prevention in such patients . \\n an 18 year old boy , known case of aplastic anemia since 7 years ago , admitted with severe headache and fever in emergency ward . \\n he was a candidate for bone marrow transplantation because of standard treatment failure that included corticosteroid , anti - thymocyte globulin ( atg ) and cyclosporine , and put on in transplant waiting list . \\n he had frequently received blood and platelet transfusion due to low hemoglobin ( hb ) level and often nose bleeding . on admission , he had severe leukopenia [ white blood cell count ( wbc ) : 100 ( without cell differentiation ) ] , anemia ( hb : 6.5 ) and severe thrombocytopenia ( platelet count : 6000 ) . \\n erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) and c - reactive protein ( crp ) were 130 and 48 , respectively . \\n after initial assessment , broad spectrum antibiotics ( piperacillin - tazobactam ) were started for him . \\n two days later , he developed pain , swelling and redness of the right side of face . \\n gradually , the patient exhibited high grade fever , chills , intolerable headache and periodic disorientation , so due to poor clinical response , an antifungal agent ( amphotericin - b deoxycholate ) was added to his antibiotic regimen on fifth day of admission . in serial physical examination ( after primary unilateral face swelling and cellulitis ) , he developed necrotic lesions in soft and hard palate followed by nasal septum , right alar groove and right nasolabial fold necrosis . \\n tomography scan ( ct scan ) was requested , which revealed right maxillary and ethmoidal sinus involvement ( fig . \\n surgical consult has been also requested for diagnostic aspiration and evaluation for surgical debridement . despite low platelet count , after receiving single donor platelet transfusion , \\n after primary aspiration , right maxillary sinus debridement was performed during single donor platelet transfusion and samples were sent for pathology . upon early surgical debridement and short time clinical improvement \\n caspofungin was added and second surgical debridement planned 10 days after the first one , and has been organized for short interval surgical sinus debridements during platelet transfusion , till it becomes completely clear . in the next surgical debridement tissue samples \\n were cultured on sabouraud dextrose agar ( merck , darmstadt , germany ) and also examined for aspergillus and candida dna by real time polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) and mucoral by nested pcr , . bacterial culture and specimen \\n finally , all involved sinuses , nasal cavity and overlying soft tissue were completely removed by anterior and posterior ethmoidectomy and sphenoidectomy . also , posterior part of septum was removed . \\n adjuvant therapy with gamma interferon 100 gr / day in combination with granulocyte - colony stimulating factor ( g - csf ) [ 300  gr / day primarily and then with full dose of 600  gr / day in two divided doses ] was added to the broad antibacterial and antifungal treatments . \\n other assessments including blood culture and urine culture were negative and chest x - ray , abdominal ultrasonography and echocardiography were normal in primary evaluations . however in serial chest x - rays , early possible signs of pulmonary involvement detected in about 3 weeks after his admission ( fig . \\n 2 ) . bilateral well - circumscribed ground - glass gray opacities were detected in these chest x - rays confirmed by spiral chest ct scan ( fig . \\n 3 ) . our further investigation into fungal infection revealed positive mucormycosis , aspergellosis and candidiasis by pcr and positive fungal culture for aspergillus flavus and candida albicans in repeated debridement ( fig . \\n sinus debridement during antifungal treatment was done in four times , but the patient 's condition gradually worse and eventually expired . \\n frequent episodes of profound and prolonged neutropenia , aggressive chemotherapy , exposure to fungal spores in non protected environment and consequently preadmission colonization with fungal agents and high risk condition such as aplastic anemia and acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) are some of typical examples that increase the risk of ifis . along with high clinical suspicions , early diagnosis and treatment ; multidisciplinary approach against ifis significantly reduced mortality . \\n constantly low absolute neutrophil count ( anc ) , lack of standard and secure control measures such as high - efficiency - particulate - air ( hepa ) in many centers and progressive nature of certain fungal infections such as mucormycosis ; all are important obstacles to our attempts toward controlling fungal infections in these patients . despite very low platelet count ( less than 610/microliter ) , \\n our patient underwent four times of successful surgical debridement , during continuous single donor platelet transfusions , without any hemostatic complications . in each times \\n he was referred to operation room after preparation of donor platelet for infusion during surgical debridement ( fig . \\n along with severe neutropenia , prolonged hospital stay and broad spectrum antibiotic therapy with damaged skin and mucosal barriers and presence of indwelling catheters predisposed our patient to colonization and infection with hospital acquired multidrug resistant organisms . \\n such patients are at greater risk for acquisition of mdr gram positive and gram negative organisms such as acinetobacters , methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsas ) and vancomycin - resistant enterococcus ( vres ) \\n . \\n this is an important point in management of these patients that should also take into consideration such as our patient which finally complicated by vre bacteremia . \\n diagnostic misconception based on primary clinical presentation is one of the other important challenges in the management of ifis in severe neutropenic patients . \\n although rhinocerebral / sino - orbital / rhinosinusitis ifis are frequently considered as clinical manifestation of mucormycosis , it is critical to obtain proper tissue specimens for culture and biopsy , whenever possible ; given the similar clinical presentations of aspergillosis . \\n mucoral family is difficult to cultivate and sensitivity of culture for this family was reported around 50%   and thus other diagnostic modalities ( histopathological carachtristics and molecular test ) should be considered , if needed . \\n co - detection of multiple fungi also is not an uncommon event in severe neutropenic patients and accurate diagnosis can help correct decision making in choosing proper antifungal regimen . although fever - driven approach for empirical antifungal therapy ; based on existing guidelines is currently applied in many hematology oncology centers worldwide , but this issue continues to be a challenge and ifis still is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in neutropenic patients with persistent fever . \\n other different treatment approaches either pre - emptive ( diagnostic - driven approach ) or targeted therapy also may be used , according to radiological findings , clinical symptoms and mycology test results . \\n these approaches have been tested by researchers in different populations and in various settings in neutropenic patients . despite the fact that implementation of these strategies substantially has reduced the burden of ifis in high risk patients , antifungal \\n currently , there is no recommendation about starting antifungal prophylaxis for patients with aplastic anemia ( as a one of the high risk groups ) in the latest guideline of infectious diseases society of america ( idsa , 2011 ) and 4th european conference on infections in leukemia ( ecil-4 , 2011 ) , . \\n although prompt diagnosis and early transplantation seem to be the only reliable modality in the protection of such patients against serious infectious complications ( mainly ifis ) , but based on our experience and also other similar reports we recommend that patients with aplastic anemia receive anti - mold prophylaxis during the period of profound and prolonged neutropenia ( anc less than 500/ microliter ) instead of other proposed strategies for the management of patients within pre - transplantation period . \\n it should be noted that in the case of aspergillosis indirect tests such as galactomannan and moleculer tests have been improved our diagnostic power for early detection of ifis due to aspergillosis . \\n yet , there is no standard diagnostic test for early detection of mucormycosis except histopathology and culture . \\n also , in centers with high incidence of mucormycosis , it seems better to better that use an agent which is active against both mucormycosis and aspegillosis for prophylaxsis . \\n the authors did not have any financial or other relationships , which could be regarded as a conflict of interest .\",\n          \"beyond its role of cellular energy currency and phosphate donor , atp plays a potent signaling role through its extracellular release and activation of cell surface purinergic receptors . \\n fast responses to atp are mediated through activation of p2x receptors , a family ( p2x1p2x7 ) of atp - activated ligand - gated ion channels and metabotropic effects through the activation of p2y receptors ( p2y12 , p2y4 , p2y6 , p2y1114 ) which couple to heterotrimeric g proteins . human leukocytes including monocytes , mast cells , neutrophils and central microglia express a diverse repertoire of p2y receptors though p2x1 , p2x4 and p2x7 are the dominant p2x subtypes present . \\n activation of purinergic receptors in leukocytes is coupled to the production and secretion of cytokines and other pro - inflammatory molecules including prostaglandin e2 . \\n purinergic receptors are associated with inflammation , with some receptors inhibited either directly ( p2y12 ) or indirectly through the activity of anti - thrombotic , in the case of platelet p2y12 , or anti - inflammatory agents , in the case of the action of statins on monocyte p2x4 . \\n atp can act as a non - peptide damage - associated molecular pattern ( damp ) release from injured cells and tissues . in this fashion \\n the release of cellular atp is unregulated and released due to cell lysis or puncture . \\n cell surface purinergic receptors are activated by this atp damp signal which serves to initiate an inflammatory response and promote wound healing . \\n however , atp can be released from cells physiologically and act as a critical signal for painful , inflammatory processes . \\n do release other nucleotides including utp and udp - sugars but our focus here is atp release . mechanisms of atp release during physiological processes remain diverse and controversial . \\n investigation into how cellular stress stimulates atp release in non - leukocytes suggests roles for connexin and pannexin hemichannels , maxi- and volume - regulated anion channels and efflux through the p2x7 receptor , though release routes and signal transduction mechanism underlying atp release in leukocytes remain poorly defined . \\n in neutrophils atp is released in response to activation of fmlp receptor by bacterially derived n - formylmethionine . \\n the precise release mechanism is unclear but occurs at the leading edge of migrating neutrophils . \\n released atp and its subsequent metabolism to adenosine at the cell surface activate p2y2 and a3 receptors serving to direct cell orientation and promote migration in response to chemotactic signals . \\n bacterially derived lipopolysaccharide can stimulate central microglia to secrete atp which in - turn activates neighboring astrocytes and modulates excitatory neurotransmission . \\n this raises the possibility that atp can act in a feed forward loop possibly amplifying responses to itself or other external cues which couple to atp secretion . \\n furthermore , such constitutive secretion leads to activation of cell surface gq - coupled p2y receptors which elevate intracellular calcium levels through release of calcium . \\n this mode of constitutive secretion generates a constant pericellular atp cloud or  halo  which appears to be important in regulating intracellular calcium homeostasis following p2y receptor activation . in cells of hematopoietic lineage such as monocyte / macrophage , nk killer and mast cells , secretory lysosomes have evolved as bifunctional organelles which combine classical degradative properties with secretion . \\n the mechanism of lysosomal atp transport remains undefined though a nucleotide transporter ( v - nut ) has been characterized for other atp containing vesicles . \\n the signal transduction coupling external cues such as cytokines , chemokines and bacterially derived molecules to atp release is poorly defined . \\n what are the release machines in leukocytes and do they differ from other cell types ? it is expected that therapeutic intervention in agonist stimulated atp release is a potentially novel route to pharmacological modulation of innate immune responses but also in chronic inflammatory disease where normal inflammatory responses are heighten and act deleteriously .\",\n          \"plexiform neurofibroma is the term applied to a diffuse neurofibromatosis of nerve trunks , which is often associated with an overgrowth of the skin and subcutaneous tissues . \\n it is a distinct type of neurofibroma that expands a nerve into a large tortuous mass of fibers that has a  bag of worms  appearance . \\n plexiform neurofibromas are the least common variant and usually are pathognomonic for nf i. the most commonly involved sites are the temple , upper lid , back of the neck , and the tongue . \\n oral manifestations of neurofibromatosis have been reported in only 4 - 7% affected persons , in which the tongue was the most commonly involved site . \\n this systemic process , originally described by von recklinghausen , is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a defect on chromosome 17 . \\n patients usually present in childhood with numerous cutaneous or subcutaneous neurofibromas , melanotic lesions in the iris called lisch nodules , caf au lait spots , and optic gliomas . \\n plexiform neurofibromas occur in only 17% of cases of nf i. when they occur in the setting of nf i , 91% are solitary lesions , and most of the lesions occur in the trunk , extremities , and head neck region . \\n histologically , neurofibroma consist of endoneural ground substance and schwann cells that extend outside the perineurium . \\n we present a case of an isolated plexiform neurofibroma of the tongue in a 11-year - old girl not associated with neurofibromatosis . \\n an 11-year - old girl was admitted to the department of e.n.t . of our institute , with the complaint of inability to close the mouth because of a large , asymmetrical , protruding tongue . \\n the girl had difficulty in swallowing , breathing , and clear speaking since early months of her life . \\n on palpation , the right side of the tongue was hypertrophied and the movements of the tongue were normal , but she was unable to hold the tongue completely in the mouth because of its enormous size . \\n there was also slight generalized swelling of the right side of the base of the tongue . \\n no neck glands were palpable and functions of v , vii , x , and xii cranial nerves were intact . \\n a magnetic resonance image was obtained to better assess the base of tongue , which revealed a 3  3  2.5 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass with infiltration in the tongue and tongue base , this lesion was hypervascular and well - circumscribed . under general anesthesia , \\n gross examination of the specimen revealed irregular surface which was soft in consistency [ figure 1 ] . \\n histopathological examination revealed well circumscribed multiple nodular lesions composed of elongated spindle wavy cells with muscle fibers in between , these wavy cells were arranged against a myxoid background . \\n an ophthalmologic examination was carried out which showed no eye lesions of neurofibromatosis ( such as lisch nodules in the iris , ephelides on eyelids , or ectopia lentis ) . \\n the skin of the whole body was examined and no caf au lait spots or frecklings of the axillary and inguinal region were observed . on plain radiograph , no bone pathology was found . \\n after the diagnostic work - up , surgical treatment was planned . under general anesthesia , \\n the tumor was approached intraorally , and the biopsy report was consistent with plexiform neurofibroma . \\n the movements of the tongue were preserved , and , in addition , a significant improvement in her speech was observed . \\n the patient has been on follow - up for 10 months and no additional treatment has been necessary . \\n gross picture of neurofibroma h and e - stained section showing spindle wavy - shaped cells seperated by fibromyxoid stroma , 400 h and e - stained section showing discrete well - circumscribed collection of spindle cells with muscle fibers in between , 100 \\n neurofibromas are benign tumors of neural origin , of which roughly 90% appear as solitary lesions . \\n solitary plexiform neurofibromas arising outside the context of nf i , as illustrated in the patient presented here , are quite rare , with only scattered cases reported in the literature till date . in the literature , there are only few reports of macroglossia caused by plexiform neurofibroma , and the cases are almost always associated with neurofibromatosis . \\n our patient had no eye lesion , no bone pathology , and no caf au lait spots or frecklings on the skin . \\n we could not find any other signs or symptoms other than isolated plexiform neurofibroma of the tongue to make a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis , and thus it was concluded to be a case of isolated plexiform neurofibroma of the tongue . when these ill - defined tumors grow in the head and neck , they are commonly symptomatic and disfiguring , causing upper airway obstruction , swallowing or mastication difficulties , or cosmetic distortion of the face . \\n diffuse plexiform neurofibroma , is also known as elephantiasis neurofibromatosa , which shows overgrowth of epidermal and subcutaneous tissue along with a wrinkled and pendulous appearance . \\n neurofibromas of the large nerves , which appear clinically as soft , drooping , and doughy masses , are benign neoplasms composed of neurites , schwann 's cells and fibroblasts within a collagenous or myxoid matrix . in contrast to schwannomas , they are nonencapsulated and engulf the nerve of origin . \\n plexiform neurofibromas , forming tortuous cords along the segments and branches of a nerve with a tendency to grow centripetally , are poorly circumscribed tumors . \\n it needs to be differentiated from schwannoma which is encapsulated , while plexiform neurofibroma is noncapsulated ; moreover , in schwannoma there are antony a and antony b along with prescence of verocay bodies on microscopic examination . since neurofibromas are usually multiple lesions , the whole body must be examined and investigated . in patient with oral neurofibroma , larynx and trachea must also be examined as in such a case lesions in the upper airway may cause respiratory obstruction . \\n plexiform neurofibromas should be monitored frequently because 5% may turn into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors . \\n differential diagnosis of such a tongue mass must include neurofibroma , schwannoma ( neurilemoma ) , lymphangioma , hemangioma , hamartoma , teratoma , pyogenic granuloma , nerve sheath myxoma , and cystic lesions such as mucoid cysts and dermoid cysts . \\n the standard treatment for neurofibromas has been surgical excision and the diagnosis can only be confirmed by histological examination . \\n early diagnosis in such a patient is very important and these patients need regular follow - up during their lifetime to detect recurrences . \\n fortunately , there were no signs of recurrence or other manifestations during the follow - up period of our patient till date . \\n we present this case for its rare site along with nonassociation with neurofibromatosis , excellent recovery , and no recurrence till date on follow - up .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6656,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"few preoperative extrapontine myelinolysis ( epm ) cases with pituitary adenoma have been reported . \\n no such case had long follow -

associated molecule pattern ( damp ) released by injured or dying cells . \\n detection of released atp by neighboring leukocytes initiates inflammation and wound healing . \\n however , recent evidence from our group and others suggests atp release by leukocytes themselves serves to regulate homeostatic mechanisms and coordinate responses to external pro - inflammatory cues . \\n examples include the homeostatic control of intracellular calcium and regulation of migratory guidance during chemotactic response to external cues . \\n though there has been some progress in elucidating atp release mechanisms of some mammalian cells types , release conduits and coupling signal transduction machinery remain larger elusive for leukocytes . \\n our recent studies suggest a role for secretory lysosomes in releasing atp in monocytes . though poorly defined , \\n targeting atp release mechanisms in leukocytes have great anti -

phase protein , ptx3 generally occurs at low levels , but it significantly increases in conditions of inflammation and infection , and the increasing level is positively correlated with the severity of disease . \\n the level of ptx3 in the blood is a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of some diseases [ 16 , 17 ] . in recent years , increasing research has focused on the association between the single - nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) of ptx3 and diseases . however , there still few reports about the effect of ptx3 polymorphism on as . in the present study , 3 snps of ptx3 were selected \\n the roles of single polymorphism and haplotype were analyzed to ensure the association . through this research \\n we recruited 194 unrelated subjects , including 101 patients with as and 93 healthy volunteers as the case and control groups , respectively , from april 2012 to december 2013 . \\n the cases , diagnosed clinically and by pathobiology in the affiliated hospital of weifang medical university , consisted of 59 males and 42 females , with an age range of 1745 years old . \\n we excluded patients with other immune or inflammatory diseases , tumors , or cardiovascular disease . \\n the controls underwent physical examination in the same hospital as the case group , showing that the control subjects were healthy . \\n the controls were required to match the cases in sex and age , so there were 61 males and 32 females in the control group and their age range was 1549 years with a mean age of 26.889.31 . \\n participants were informed about the entire experiment and provided written consent before collection of samples . in this study , \\n the detailed clinical information of all subjects was surveyed and recorded , including age , sex , body mass index ( bmi ) , cigarette and alcohol consumption , and the expression level of ptx3 . \\n smokers were defined as people who smoked more than 1 cigarette every day for at least 2 years , and drinkers were defined as people who drank liquor or beer at least twice a week . \\n we drew 3 ml of venous blood from every subject on an empty stomach in the morning ; 1 ml of the blood sample was centrifuged to separate plasma at 4000 rpm for 10 min . \\n plasma ptx3 was measured using an enzyme -

c - c might be a risk factor in the onset of as ( or=1.63 , 95%ci=0.972.73 ) . \\n the characteristics of the subjects are listed in table 1 . in this study population , there were more males  58.42% in cases and 65.59% in controls  but there were no significant differences in age and sex between as patients and healthy controls ( p>0.05 ) . \\n similarly , cigarette and alcohol consumption were also not associated with the onset of as ( p>0.05 ) . however , in as patients bmi was significantly higher than in controls and overweight people were at greater risk of as ( p=0.01 ) . \\n it was worth noting that the expression level of ptx3 protein in cases also remarkably increased compared to the controls ( p=0.01 ) . \\n the distribution of genotypes and alleles of rs2305619 was not significantly different between the case and control groups ( p>0.05 ) . \\n however , in rs3816527 , compared with the common genotype aa , the cc genotype frequency in the 2 groups was significantly different ( p=0.04 ) and it showed a significant association with the risk of as ( or=3.14 , 95%ci=1.049.52 ) . \\n c allele carriers were at greater risk of as ( or=1.65 , 95%ci=1.062.56 ) . in the analysis of rs3845978 , ct genotype , but not tt genotype , was revealed to be associated with increased risk of as , ( or=1.92 , 95%ci=1.053.51 ) . \\n carrying t allele in the genotype was also a risk factor for as development ( or=1.94 , 95%ci=1.093.47 ) . \\n t allele itself also conferred a 1.68 times greater risk of as in our study population ( or=1.68 , 95%ci=1.042.70 ) . \\n rs2305619 , rs3816527 , and rs3845978 polymorphisms were involved in a block of ptx3 gene in haploview and a strong ld existed among these 3 polymorphisms . \\n they made up 5 haplotypes in this population and the detailed information is shown in table 3 . among them , g - c - t haplotype frequency was obviously higher in as patients than in healthy people ( p=0.02 ) and it was closely correlated with as risk ( or=2.86 , 95%ci=1.127.26 ) . \\n in addition , haplotype a - c - c might be a risk factor in the onset of as ( or=1.63 , 95%ci=0.972.73 ) . \\n a clinical symptom of as is inflammatory back pain , and over time patients may develop spine rigidity and loss of mobility . \\n studies proved that as mostly attacks people 2030 years old , especially men , so it causes a heavy burden on society and the economy . \\n due to its unclear pathogenesis , the prevention and treatment of as are not adequate . \\n recently , several hypotheses about the pathology of as have been proposed , such as the genetic hypothesis , the unfolded protein response ( upr ) hypothesis , and the immune , bacterial infection , and endocrine factor hypotheses , and tnf- is also considered to be involved in the onset of as , but these are rather one - sided approached to the problem . \\n they are independent of each other in terms of the body s reaction , but they are also linked to each other . \\n entheseal stress caused by infection , micro - lesions , and biomechanics leads to acute inflammatory reaction and the activation of progenitor cells . in some circumstances \\n , these acute events subside as soon as they restore the homeostasis , but in particular cases , acute events develop into chronic events that show inflammation and ossification . genetic factors may regulate the chronic inflammation and participate in the alterations of joints and surrounding tissues in as patients . \\n for example , xu et al . analyzed the studies of many scholars and found that interleukin receptor gene polymorphisms ( rs7517847 and rs2201841 ) are significantly correlated with as . \\n it is induced by some proinflammatory factors , such as leukocyte - specific protein ( lsp ) , interleukin-1 ( il-1 ) , and tumor necrosis factor- ( tnf- ) in endothelial cells , monocytes , and myocardial cells . as a dissoluble model recognition receptor \\n , ptx3 plays an important role in innate immune reaction and is closely correlated with immune function , infectious diseases , and atherosclerosis of the coronary artery . \\n it has been reported that ptx3 expression level was elevated in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) , which is a chronic inflammatory disease , and was associated with the disease activity . \\n found that increased ptx3 level regulates the inflammatory processes involved in cardiovascular disease in rheumatoid arthritis patients . \\n similarly , as a rheumatic inflammatory disease , as occurrence may be associated with ptx3 level . \\n furthermore , genetic polymorphism influences the gene and relative protein expression level , which is not rare . \\n therefore , exploring the association of ptx3 polymorphisms with as susceptibility is feasible and essential . in the basic clinical information of subjects , we found that bmi index was significantly higher in as patients than in healthy people and the content of ptx3 protein remarkably increased in the case group , so they may be the risk factors for as , but not cigarette or alcohol consumption . \\n another study indicated that ptx3 polymorphisms are associated with plasma ptx3 levels , showing that individuals with aa genotype of rs2305619 and cc genotype of rs3816527 have high plasma levels of ptx3 . \\n investigation of the association between ptx3 single polymorphism and as susceptibility shows that rs2305619 does not have a direct association with the risk of as development . however , the cc genotype and c allele frequencies in rs3816527 were remarkably higher in as patients than in controls , and increased the risk of as in our study group . \\n similarly , in rs3845978 , ct genotype increased the risk of as development , and carrying t allele of rs3845978 in the genotype was also a risk factor . in the combined analysis of the 3 ptx3 snps , \\n a strong ld was detected ; therefore , haplotype analysis was part of our design . \\n g - c - t haplotype carriers had a higher risk of developing as than g - a - c haplotype carriers , and a - c - c haplotype may also be a susceptible haplotype in our study population . \\n we found that ptx3 rs3816527 and rs3845978 polymorphisms were associated with the generation and development of as . \\n firstly , this result was established only in our study population , so we can not generalize our results to other populations . \\n thirdly , other factors that may contribute to the occurrence of as were not included in the present study . considering the possible environmental factors involved , larger samples from different populations and countries\",\n          \"a total of 781 consecutive diabetic patients , mean  sem age 59  0.5 years and diabetes duration 11.8  0.4 years , treated at the diabetes outpatient clinic of the university clinics of vienna from 1 january 2006 to 17 february 2007 were studied . upon entry in the study , a careful medical history with special focus on cardiovascular disease \\n all patients were asked to complete the minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire and the dyspnoe score chart . blood pressure \\n , heart rate , electrocardiogram , and a blood sample for the determination of serum cholesterol , triglycerides , creatinine , a1c , blood glucose , and the markers were obtained from each patient , and new york heart association ( nyha ) stage was assessed . \\n the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki ii and was approved by the local ethics committee . \\n total cholesterol , ldl cholesterol , hdl cholesterol , triglycerides , blood glucose , a1c , and serum creatinine were determined using standard laboratory procedures . \\n glomerular filtration rate ( gfr ) was calculated by the cockroft -

proadm , ct - proavp , ct - proet-1 , and mr - proanp ; 2 ) mr - proanp and mr - proadm are significant independent predictors of cardiovascular events in this patient group ; and 3 ) all four markers are independent from each other predictor of serum levels of creatinine ( and of gfr ) . \\n plasma levels of all four markers were significantly higher in patients reaching the composite end point and significantly higher in patients with increasing severity of cardiac symptoms at baseline as assessed by nyha stage . \\n all four markers were useful as predictors of future cardiovascular events , with mr - proanp being the strongest . in this sample , the two markers mr - proadm and mr - proanp proved to be stronger predictors of an event than traditional risk markers . \\n ct - pro - avp and ct - proet only remained significant in a stepwise but not in a forced - entry cox regression model . \\n of note , all four parameters showed a very good negative predictive quality , a property that would be very valuable were these parameters to be used in a clinical setting . \\n the information that a patient currently has a lower risk for the occurrence of a cardiovascular event over the next year helps clinicians to better target aggressive management and close monitoring to those who really have a higher risk . \\n nh2-terminal - pro brain natriuretic peptide , another natriuretic peptide marker , also showed a high npv in a population comparable to the sample presented here . \\n again , nt - pobnp was superior to traditional risk factors in the prediction of cardiovascular events ( 21 ) . \\n mr - proanp , the strongest predictor in this sample , has been studied in comparison with nt - probnp as the survival predictor in the setting of chronic heart failure ( 12 ) and acute cardiac failure and has been found to be noninferior to this established parameter . \\n it has been shown repeatedly that diabetic nephropathy is a main risk factor for future cardiovascular events ( 22 ) . in confirmation of these observations , in this sample serum creatinine was significantly higher and glomerular filtration rate was significantly lower in those reaching the composite end point over the short time frame of a little more than 1 year . \\n in addition , baseline serum creatinine was strongly associated with all four serum markers of vascular function , and all four remained independent predictors of serum creatinine in the stepwise linear regression model . \\n although creatinine was a highly significant predictor of outcome in a model including traditional risk markers , it became insignificant if any one of the four markers were added . \\n both adrenomedullin and endothelin may be produced by renal endothelial cells and have been studied in the context of nephropathy and renal failure ( 23 ) ; in this sample of diabetic patients the stable serum markers mr - proadm and ct - proet-1 also correlated with gfr and serum creatinine . in another sample of type 2 \\n diabetic patients mr - proadm was increased in the presence of nephropathy and was related to insulin resistance ( 15 ) . \\n the markers mr - proanp and ct - proavp have been studied in the context of sepsis and myocardial infarction ( 24 ) and have been used as outcome parameters regarding morbidity and mortality . \\n these parameters , to our knowledge , have not been studied in patients with diabetes and in the context of diabetic nephropathy . however \\n , ct - proavp ( copeptin ) has been shown to correlate negatively with gfr in chronic heart failure ( 10 ) , and mr - proanp was negatively correlated with serum creatinine in chronic heart failure ( 13 ) . \\n thus , the close relationship of these parameters both with mr - proadm and ct - proet as well as with serum creatinine is noteworthy . \\n it is not known how the precursor peptides of the vasoactive peptides are cleared from the circulation , and decreased renal clearance is at least a partial explanation for the correlation of all four peptides with kidney function . alternatively or in addition , the increase in the plasma levels of the four peptides could also be explained by increased production due to endothelial stress . \\n this natriuretic property is thought to be beneficial , and the fact that patients with heart failure do not have increased natriuresis but instead fluid retention and edema is thought to be due to ( renal ) resistance to the effect . \\n thus , the upregulation of natriuretic peptides in heart failure is thought to be physiological and cardio- and renoprotective . \\n the higher levels of these peptides in patients progressing to an event would therefore represent an increased compensating effort of the body . \\n interestingly , in this study sample all four markers were independent predictors of serum creatinine in the multivariate linear regression analysis . \\n this interesting finding underscores the complex regulation of kidney function with apparently each of the different peptide hormones ( vasopressin , adrenomedullin , endothelin , and atrial natriuretic peptide ) playing a distinct role in the diabetic kidney . in the study sample \\n presented here , the stable markers of all four peptides correlated strongly with each other ( data not shown ) , despite their different origin , and all of them were higher in patients with a future event than in those who remained event free . \\n to our knowledge , this is the first report of the four markers mr - proadm , ct - proet-1 , mr - proanp , and ct - proavp in a large sample of patients with diabetes . \\n the data presented here describe a close relationship between renal function parameters and the four serum markers and a relationship of mr - proanp in particular and to a lesser extent the other three markers and the occurrence of cardiovascular events over a time frame of < 1 year in a cohort of diabetic patients . \\n thus , these markers ( or , rather , the active peptides for which they are surrogate markers ) could be factors linking renal function to cardiovascular events . \\n \",\n          \"in recent years , abdominal muscle training has gained increasing popularity , and exercises \\n like  crunches  or \\n abdominal training serves to improve core stability , which is the ability to \\n strengthen the lumbopelvic complex and transfer forces from the upper to the lower limbs of \\n the body while maintaining the spine in a neutral position1 , 2 . \\n the  core  region of the \\n body has been anatomically described as a box , with the abdominals at the front , spinal and \\n gluteal muscles at the back , the diaphragm on the top , and the pelvic floor and hip muscles \\n on the bottom3 . \\n generally , the core \\n muscles , which form the primary muscle group for maintaining spinal stability4 , can be divided into two groups according to \\n their functions and attributes : local system and global system5 . the most common traditional exercises21 \\n and training methods to enhance abdominal strength and stability employ body weight \\n exercises consisting of static or dynamic contractions in various body positions ( e.g. , \\n supine , lateral ) , starting with isolated movements and then continuing through with more \\n complex sequences1 , 6 such as crunches , sit - ups , and planks ( prone or lateral ) . \\n however , \\n such exercises , especially the crunch , are performed with repeated flexions and lateral \\n bending motions that produce vertebral compression at high lumbar overloads and therefore \\n may be injurious for the spine7,8,9,10,11 . \\n correct breathing ( especially as it involves the respiratory muscles ) is vital to abdominal \\n training because respiratory muscles are directly involved during common core stability \\n exercises12,13,14 . \\n found that \\n the diaphragm is actively recruited in many resistance training exercises , including \\n sit - ups13 . \\n other studies demonstrated \\n that the respiratory muscles are involved in a variety of activities in which respiration is \\n not primarily involved12 , 13 , 15 , 16 . \\n because breathing is one of the most basic patterns \\n directly related to human movement17 , as \\n seen in neonates18 , 19 , inefficient breathing may result in muscular imbalance and motor \\n control alterations that can affect general motor quality17 . to our knowledge \\n , few publications to date have evaluated the impact of breathing in \\n relation to abdominal exercises . \\n our hypothesis was that exercises based on a combination of \\n global stretching postures , which are advantageous for improving respiratory apparatus \\n efficiency20 , and breathing exercises \\n may exert a concurrent positive effect on core function and body movement . \\n the aim of this \\n study was to evaluate whether , as compared with a training protocol of common exercises21 , abdominal training plus breathing \\n exercises would more greatly enhance abdominal fitness , quality of movement , and respiratory \\n function . \\n all participants gave their written informed consent after having been informed about the \\n objectives and scope , procedures , risks , and benefits of the study . \\n participation was \\n voluntary , and withdrawal from the study was permitted at any time . \\n all procedures were \\n carried out in accordance with the declaration of helsinki ; the study protocol was approved \\n by the university s institutional review board . \\n the study sample comprised 32 healthy male nonsmokers without pulmonary disease or a \\n history of low back pain ( experimental group [ eg ] n = 16 , mean age 30  2  years , height 1.73 \\n  3 m , weight 67  2  kg ; control group [ cg ] , n = 16 , mean age 28  3  years , height 1.76  2 \\n m , weight 70  3  kg ) . before the start of the study , all subjects engaged in regular \\n physical activity at least 3 times per week with a training regimen that included \\n medium - intensity aerobic activity ( 6575% heart rate maximum ) for at least 45 minutes and a \\n resistance training program that included free - weight and machine exercises to 6070% of one \\n repetition maximum ( 1rm ) for 2 days per week . \\n the subjects were matched and randomly \\n assigned to two groups as determined by a chance process ( a random number generator on a \\n computer ) that could not be predicted . \\n no \\n other physical exercise , aside from that specified for the purposes of this study , was \\n performed during the study period . \\n respiratory measurements were taken with the subjects comfortably seated and the trunk at a \\n 90 angle . \\n pulmonary function was measured with a portable spirometer ( pony fx , cosmed , \\n rome , italy ) while the subjects were wearing a nose clip . \\n the test was repeated three to five times to \\n obtain at least two acceptable trials ( variability < 100  ml ) , with a 2-minute rest \\n interval between the trials to ensure adequate recovery . \\n a single experienced investigator interpreted the data according to established \\n guidelines23 to obtain a target value \\n for each subject and to ensure that the maneuver had been performed correctly . forced vital \\n capacity ( fvc ) , forced expiratory volume in one second ( fev1 ) , and peak \\n expiratory flow ( pef ) were evaluated . \\n the american college of sports medicine ( acsm ) curl - up ( cadence ) test and the functional \\n movement screen ( fms ) , two simple , practical , valid , and reliable tests17 , 24,25,26 , \\n were used to assess abdominal muscle fitness . the acsm curl - up ( cadence ) test evaluates \\n local muscular endurance of the abdominal muscle groups , which are important for good \\n posture and performing various daily tasks . \\n the fms evaluates the efficiency of \\n basic human motion , for example , as during breathing ; a proper breathing pattern in turn \\n influences movement efficiency17 , 24 . \\n the acsm curl - up ( cadence ) test protocol is carried out with the subject lying on his or \\n her back on a mat with knees bent at a 90 angle and feet on the floor . \\n the arms are \\n extended to the sides with the fingers touching a piece of masking tape . a second piece of \\n tape is placed 12  cm beyond the first piece . \\n for this study , the metronome was set to 40 \\n beats per minute . at the first beep \\n , the subject lifts his or her shoulder blades off the \\n mat by flexing the spine until the fingertips reach the second piece of tape . at the next \\n beep \\n , the subject slowly returns the shoulder blades to the mat by flattening the lower \\n back . \\n the subject performs as many curl -

up , and rotary \\n stability . \\n movement competency is graded on a scale from 0 to 3 points based on how the \\n tasks are accomplished : 0 indicates movement with pain , 1 indicates inability to perform the \\n pattern , 2 indicates pattern performed with compensations or imperfections , and 3 indicates \\n pattern performed as directed . \\n instruction and administration of the fms were \\n carried out by a certified fms instructor according to published \\n guidelines27,28,29 . \\n the two training protocols were administered for 15 minutes twice per week for 6 weeks in \\n both groups ; all exercises were performed after a standardized 10-minute warm - up consisting \\n of cycling on a stationary bike . \\n the eg exercises were focused on achieving and maintaining \\n a proper diaphragmatic breathing pattern for 23 seconds during inspiration and 810 seconds \\n during expiration , with a vocal sound emitted to induce active recruitment of the pelvic \\n floor muscles and deep internal abdominals30,31,32 . \\n to do this , the subject inhales , expanding the lower abdominal region , the side and back of \\n the abdomen , and the lower ribs . \\n the chest is kept relaxed without pushing out the stomach , \\n and the head is aligned with the spine to avoid excessive bending of the spine or body \\n compensations . \\n he or she \\n stretches the arms upward , and on exhalation , produces a sound from the mouth , maintaining \\n the spine aligned and stretched . \\n the subject sits with the spine erect , lower limbs elongated , and arms extended in front \\n of the chest . during exhalation , a vocal sound \\n the subject sits in a kneeling position with buttocks resting on his heels and legs \\n slightly apart ; the face is directed forward with the left arm bent overhead . during \\n exhalation , \\n a sound is produced while starting to bend the body laterally and stretching the \\n opposite side of the body . \\n the subject sits in a kneeling position , with one arm bent in front of the eyes and the \\n other resting on the floor . during inhalation \\n , the trunk is rotated to the right while \\n maintaining normal spinal curvature . during exhalation , a vocal sound \\n the cg exercises were chosen from a variety of common exercises21 during which a spontaneous breathing rhythm ( 1 second for \\n inspiration and 1 second for expiration ) is maintained in the following sequence : 1 . \\n crunch : the subject lies on his back with knees bent , feet on the floor , and hands \\n resting on the chest . \\n during inhalation , the shoulders are lifted off the ground ; during \\n exhalation , the subject returns to the starting position . \\n 2 . crunch with rotation : the subject lies on his back with knees bent and feet on the \\n floor . during exhalation , the trunk is lifted and rotated ; during inhalation , the subject \\n returns to the starting position . \\n supine bridge : the subject lies on his back with knees bent and feet on the floor . \\n during exhalation , the pelvis is lifted an inch off the floor while pressing into the soles \\n of the feet . during inhalation \\n 4 . prone bridge : the subject begins prone in a  table position  with knees under the hips \\n and arms under the shoulder ; on inhalation , the right leg is simultaneously lifted straight \\n out and behind , and the left arm is lifted straight out in front . \\n the routine for exercise numbers 1 and 2 consisted of two series of 15 repetitions each . \\n exercise numbers 3 and 4 consisted of two series for 10 seconds in isometric contraction . \\n all sessions were supervised by an expert instructor to ensure that the exercises were \\n properly performed . \\n data were entered into a personal computer , and all statistical analyses were performed \\n using the statistical package for the social sciences ibm spss version 21.0 ( ibm corp . , \\n armonk , ny , usa ) . \\n two -

up ( cadence ) test and fms scores were in line with \\n normative data , whereas after training , the scores on both tests were in the above - normal \\n average only in the eg24 , 35 . \\n specifically , the raw scores of the fms test , whole body \\n stability and balance patterns , as evaluated for the parameters rotary stability and trunk \\n stability push up , improved from 1.3  au to 2  au in the eg , indicating improved body control \\n due to a better respiratory pattern . in shoulder mobility , \\n the eg improved \\n from a medium to the highest score ( 2.4  au before , 3  au after training ) , whereas the cg \\n remained unchanged with a medium score ( 2.5  au before , and 2.6  au after training ) . \\n the same \\n trend was noted on the active straight leg raise test . concerning whole body patterns ( deep \\n squat , hurdle step , in line lunge ) , the eg improved from a low to a medium score on each of \\n the three patterns ( 1.62.5  au , 1.4 2  au , and 1.62.4  au , respectively ) , whereas most \\n values remained unchanged in the cg . \\n as reported in previous studies , proper diaphragmatic breathing is directly linked to \\n better functional movement17 , but \\n combining proper breathing with global stretching postures can produce a greater effect on \\n such functional parameters , as measured on mobility , stability , and whole body pattern \\n tests . regarding the biomechanical aspects of breathing , the expiration phase promotes \\n active recruitment of the abdominal muscles , contrasting the natural elevation of the rib \\n cage ( induced by raising the arms overhead ) ; to the contrary , elevating the arms raises the \\n anterior chest wall , makes the thoracolumbar column hyperlordotic , and puts the diaphragm in \\n an oblique position that inhibits its proper function . during exhalation \\n , the thoracolumbar \\n spine returns to a more neutral position ( opposing the previous hyperlordosis ) , and the \\n diaphragm is more horizontal without posterior pelvic tilt34 . \\n the subject should inhale to expand the lower portion of the \\n abdominal region , the side and back parts of the abdomen and lower ribs , keeping the spine \\n aligned and the chest relaxed . \\n using a correct diaphragmatic breathing pattern promotes \\n co - contraction of the abdominal muscles in the so - called bracing technique , which provides \\n trunk stiffness and stability36 , 37 . when focusing on diaphragmatic breathing , it is important not only to reestablish a correct \\n respiratory pattern but also to ensure lumbar spine stabilization by increasing \\n intra - abdominal pressure38,39,40,41 and activation of the core structures to transfer forces \\n from the center of the body to the lower extremities . to produce an economic breathing \\n pattern , all joints must be centered in a stable position to involve all muscular chains . \\n the head , eyes , and spinal curves should all be aligned with the pelvis and the hips down to \\n the knees and feet . \\n this can be achieved with proper diaphragmatic breathing and adequate \\n muscle tone distribution ( as can be trained with eg exercises)18 , 19 . \\n the combined eg exercises may offer several other advantages : first , recruitment of the \\n deep abdominals increases intra - abdominal pressure and coactivation of the entire abdominal \\n wall34 , which has a fundamental role in \\n providing adequate support for spine and trunk stiffness42 , 43 . \\n second , in contrast \\n with crunches , there are no repeated flexions that could be injurious to the vertebrae7,8,9 . \\n third , the spine remains in a neutral \\n posture34 , so the abdominals can be \\n trained in an elongated and normal position . in sports or activities of daily \\n living , people \\n rarely flex the rib cage to the pelvis , thus shortening the rectus abdominis9 . \\n the sample size was small , and the subjects did \\n not belong to a specific population . \\n in addition , electromyographic assessment of the \\n abdominal muscles was not performed . in conclusion , \\n eg exercises that incorporate correct breathing patterns and body \\n flexibility offer an alternative to traditional abdominal exercises . \\n as such , they may be \\n useful for coaches or physical therapists when selecting core exercises to improve overall \\n abdominal fitness and pulmonary function and to retrain correct diaphragmatic breathing and \\n whole body movements . \\n further research is needed to compare abdominal breathing with other \\n core exercises in order to clarify the combination of breath and abdominal exercises in \\n treating painful disorders ( low back pain , neck pain ) and improving motor control in fitness \\n and rehabilitation programs .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 29991,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"osteomesopyknosis is a rare sclerosing bone disorder of autosomal dominant inheritance . \\n we report a first case of osteomesopyknosis in korea . \\n a 16-year old girl complained of diffuse back pain for 1 year . \\n we performed physical examination , biochemical investigations and imaging studies . \\n a radiograph of spine revealed rugger -
